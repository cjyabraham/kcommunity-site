# Kubernetes Contributor Site Generator

This repository contains the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site and generator scripts for the
Kubernetes Contributor site.  Much of the content is generated from the [kubernetes/commmunity](https://github.com/kubernetes/community)
directly and care should be taken when working within the [content directory](content/) directly. 

The heavy lifting occurs within the [gen-site.sh](gen-site.sh) script. If not being called externally,
it will clone the [kubernetes/commmunity](https://github.com/kubernetes/community) within the
[build](build/) directory then sync specific directories and files to the [content directory](content/). 

Content is synced following the below rules:
* Directories prefixed with `sig-` will be synced to the `special-interest-groups` directory.
* Directories prefixed with `wg-` will be synced to the `working-groups` directory.
* Other directories not included in the [exclude.list](exclude.list) are copied to the 
  root of the [content directory](content/).
* Files at the root of the directory will **only** be copied over if they are listed in the
  [include.list](include.list) with the exclusion of `sig-list.md` and `README.md`.
* `sig-list.md` is copied to both the `special-interest-groups` and `working-groups` and renamed
  to `README.md`.
* The `README.md` from the root of the community repo is copied over to the root of the
  [content directory](content/) for now.


Next it will go through all the files within the [content directory](content/) and search for any
links that may need to be corrected to function outside of github along with inserting a [front-matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/)
header (if needed).

Lastly, any `README.md` files are renamed to `_index.md`. These function similarly to `README.md`
files within a GitHub repository, but are what Hugo is expecting.

At that point the site can be previewed locally with `hugo serve`, or the site built with `hugo`.
If it is built, the default location is `build/public`. 


# Building the Site

The Kubernetes Contributor Site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  For instructions on
installing and general usage, see the [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

Once Hugo is installed, clone the repository locally and update the submodule to fetch the theme.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mrbobbytables/kcommunity-site.git
$ cd kcommunity-site
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

Once complete, simply run the [`gen-site.sh`](gen-site.sh), script to pull down the [kubernetes/commmunity](https://github.com/kubernetes/community)
repository and generate the site content. 

After the script completes, the site can be previewed by executing `hugo serve` from the project
directory. If satisfied with your changes, the site can be fully rendered with the `hugo` command
to the `build/public` directory.

### Note to MAC Users
OSX by default ships with an outdated version of bash that does not support all the functionality
used by the site generator script. Bash can be safely updated via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
Once installed, execute the below commands to install a newer version of bash.
```
$ brew install bash
$ sudo bash -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/bash >> /etc/shells'
$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
```
You may need to restart or log out and log back in again to have it fully apply.
